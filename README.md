# Parabank – Selenium WebDriver Testing

This project showcases automated functional testing using **Selenium WebDriver** on the Parabank banking demo website. It focuses on verifying user-critical flows such as registration, login, account creation, transfers, and withdrawals through a reusable and scalable Java-based test suite.

## 📁 Project Structure

Selenium test classes are located in:

s3962111-SeleniumTest/src/test/java


Each test targets a specific user action (e.g., signing up, transferring funds) and follows a modular class structure.

## ✅ Testing Highlights

- 🤖 Developed automation tests for **core banking features** including registration, login, balance checks, fund transfers, and opening new accounts.  
- 🔁 Built reusable and structured test classes with `@BeforeAll`, `@Test`, and `@AfterAll`, enabling scalable and maintainable automation.  
- 📈 Integrated test case management using **SpiraPlan**, linking each test to a defined requirement and generating pass/fail execution reports.  
- 🔍 Validated normal and edge-case scenarios such as incorrect login attempts, empty form submissions, and invalid transfer amounts.
